# Quotes Studio Web App

This is a simple web app that displays quotes from a free API and allows users to add their own quotes manually. It was built using ReactJS and CSS.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, simply clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quotes-web-app.git

# Change into the project directory
cd quotes-web-app

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Running the App

To run the app locally, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser.

## Using the App

Once the app is running, you can browse quotes from the API or add your own manually.

### Browse Quotes from the API

To browse quotes from the API, simply click the "Get Quote" button. This will display a random quote from the API.

### Add Quotes Manually

To add quotes manually, click the "Add Quote" button. This will display a form where you can enter the author and text of the quote.

Once you have entered the quote information, click the "Submit" button to add the quote to the app. The quote will be saved in the app's state and will be displayed in the list of quotes.
